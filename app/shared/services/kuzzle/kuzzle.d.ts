     * This is the case, for instance, with the local authentication strategy.

     * If the request succeeds but there is no token, then it means that the chosen strategy is a two-steps authentication method, like OAUTH. In that case, the loginAttempt event is not fired. To complete the login attempt, the setJwtToken method must be called either with a token or with an appropriate Kuzzle response.
